I only learned a couple of days ago that there is already another Speedometer
addon available for Rift (SinRopa's Speed-o-Meter)! Had I realized, I probably
wouldn't have spent the time here (not enough addon authors right now to go
duplicating effort after all!), but I did want to try to write my own Gadget
and this seemed an easy one to start with. Since it was so far along I decided
to finish it.

This Gadget is intended to be used with the included wwDigital font. The
capability is provided to change fonts in case wwDigital is completely
unsuitable to your UI, but if you use another font, spacing will probably be
suboptimal and you'll want to turn off the RPS and MPH options.

A big shout-out to Adelea for the font-selection code. And of course to
Wildtide for the Gadgets framework.

A note about speeds & distances in Rift:

It seems the "original" running speed in Rift was set to 5 rift units per
second (a "rift unit" is the length that map coordinates are based upon and is
very close to a meter--1.03 rift units in a meter, a figure derived from upon
looking at spell ranges).  After the run speed increase in December 2012, the
standard speed was boosted to about 6.1 rps. So when your character's running,
you'll see an average speed of around 6.1, or 122% of original speed. It seems
to vary a bit between characters.

I decided not to recalibrate the new speed to 100% in the addon because to do
so would throw off all calculations for mount speeds and other speed boosts.
Your 150% mount would look like it was going about 130%, etc.
