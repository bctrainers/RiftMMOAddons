2.02r3: /aileen
- Added spark color change command /gcd color R G B

2.02r2: /aileen
- Reduced CPU usage
- Smarter way to detect if ability used is non-GCD

2.02r1:
- Converted to 2.2 Event system
- Completely redid the ability detection mechanism

2.01r8:
- Moved ability detection to coroutine, and removed bulk check. Should hopefully stop excess CPU termination.
- Reduced CPU usage

2.01r7:
- Added numeric display of GCD timer. /gcd number to toggle
- Should use considerably less CPU when in form that has no detectable CDs (mechs in SBP)
  If CD ability detection fails, throttle checks to 1 every 10 seconds.
		
2.01r6 - The programmatic detection of CD abilities can still pick the wrong ones.
		Swap to a defined set of abilities (the 0 pt ones in each soul)

/gcd info - to show current settings
/gcd cdreset - to reset current GCD track ability
